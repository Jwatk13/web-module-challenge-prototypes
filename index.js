/*
  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + .eat() should recieve a string as a parameter and take some type of edible as an argument
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach` array.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` array should be empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/*
  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method
      + should take 'gallons' as an parameter which will take number of gallons as an argument
      + should add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

/*
  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies also have the ability to `.play()`:
        + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.
*/

  return `Playing with ${this.favoriteToy}, ${this.favoriteToy} being the favorite toy.`
}

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. WINDOW BINDING: this happens if you use 'this' without proper context for it then it will return the window, 
  the global object in node, or undefined in strict mode.
  2. IMPLICIT BINDING: When a function on an object is invoked the 'this' keyword refers to whatever comes before the key.
  We are not directing it to a certain path, it follows its native path and finds the object its supposed to refer to;
  3. EXPLICIT BINDING: With this type of binding we direct the 'this' keyword to follow a certain path by invoking functions
  that we want it to refer to. 
  4. NEW BINDING: Here the 'this' keyword refers to the newly created object that it is pointed towards to get its data from
  rather than the old object.
